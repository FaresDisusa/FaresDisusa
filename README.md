###<h2> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" width="35px" height="35px"/> About Me </h2>
I'm a 17-year-old student from Tunisia 🇹🇳 who just really loves computer science, system architecture, and figuring out how to build things from scratch 😁. My main goal right now is building a strong portfolio for university applications (MIT, Stanford, EPFL are the dream! ✨)

Long-term, I'd love to contribute to solving interesting challenges at a company like Google.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

My main project for the last couple of years has been an algorithmic trading system for Bitcoin. It's been a huge learning process 😅! This project involves:

* **Algorithmic Core:** Writing and testing different swing trading algorithms in Python.
* **ML & Data Architecture:** Hooking up a data pipeline with **Google Pub/Sub** to stream market data, using **Apache Airflow** to manage the workflow. This pipeline feeds the ML models and has checks to help make sure the data is clean.
* **Advanced ML Architecture:** The current big idea I'm experimenting with is a system with a **meta-model** that manages a ensemble of specialized **expert models**. The goal is to let the system pick the best model for whatever the market is doing at the moment.

> **Heads-up:** The repo for this project is private for now! It's still a heavy work-in-progress, but I definitely plan to open-source it once it's more polished and ready for the world. 🛠️

Aside from my main project, I'm also deeply interested in:
* **Quantum Computing:** Trying to keep up with what's happening in quantum... it's wild! 🤯
* **Business & Market Analysis:** Researching the business models of tech companies, investment strategies, and the economics of software.
* **Productivity:** Developing efficient workflows and systems for self-improvement and focused work.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

* Going deeper into Machine Learning with an advanced course 🧠.
* Getting better at deploying services on GCP.
* Outside of tech, I'm also learning Spanish, ¡Hola! 🇪🇸
