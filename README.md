## 0x01. About

> **Status:** High School Student (Tunisia) | Class of 2027  
> **Focus:** High-Performance Computing, Financial Engineering, Computational Biology.

I do not just write code; I design systems. My work focuses on creating autonomous infrastructure capable of **strategic, market-adaptive execution**. While my academic path is aimed at institutions like **MIT** or **Stanford**, my operational focus is on deploying production-grade architectures today.

Current Directive: **Scaling automated trading systems & Exploring pharmacogenomics.**

## 0x02. The Flagship: Quantitative Swing Trading System

This is not a script, it is an industrial-grade pipeline designed for the Bitcoin markets. The source code is proprietary, but the architecture is fully documented.

### 🏛️ Project: Disuza Quantitative Architecture
**Role:** Lead Architect & Developer  
**Stack:** Python, Vertex AI, Apache Airflow, Glassnode API (Professional Tier).

The system operates on a sophisticated data-streaming architecture:
1.  **Ingestion:** Real-time on-chain and derivative data streaming via Google Pub/Sub.
2.  **Orchestration:** ETL pipelines managed by Apache Airflow for data integrity.
3.  **Intelligence:** An ensemble of ML models (Expert Models) governed by a Meta-Model selector to adapt to market volatility regimes.

> 📂 **Access the Documentation:** https://github.com/DisuzaQuantitative/Disuza-Quantitative 
> *Note: This repository contains the complete system documentation, architectural diagrams, and methodology. The core execution engine remains private.*

## 0x03. Technical Arsenal

I favor reliability and precision over trends.

## 0x04. Horizon

My roadmap is driven by impact, not curriculum.

* **Now:** Refining the Swing Trading Algorithm (Live Simulation Phase).
* **Near Future:** Structuring the Holding Company & Capital Allocation.
* **Long Term:** Bio-computation & Longevity Research (Solving aging as an engineering problem).
